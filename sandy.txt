I'll recap the commands used here:
First of all, open your git bash terminal (if you are on Windows) by right clicking and selecting 'git bash here'.
1) First we made an empty folder (aka repository) by 'mkdir git_workshop'. You can also made a new folder after right clicking, and then renaming it manually.
2) We entered the newly created folder by 'cd git_workshop'.
3) We initialized a git repository (the hidden .git folder) by 'git init'.
4) We made a simple markdown (.md) or a text file (.txt) by 'touch README.md' or 'touch README.txt'. You can also make a text file manually by right clicking and renaming the file as README.txt.
5) We opened the newly created text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file by 'subl README.md'. 'subl' here is a shortcut to open the file in Sublime Editor. You can also open the file manually in Notepad.
6) We added some text to the file.
7) We used 'git add . ' (note the dot at the end of the command)  to add the files in the 'git_workshop' folder in the staging area.
8) We used 'git commit -m "This is a commit message" ' to commit the files and the changes we made to our git repository.
